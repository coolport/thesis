# Project Explained: How We're Building a Smart Traffic Light

This document explains the entire thesis project from a high-level, conceptual standpoint. It's designed for anyone who wants to understand the goals and the process without needing to read the code.

## The Big Picture: What's the Problem?

Everyone hates being stuck in traffic. A major reason for congestion is that most traffic lights are "dumb." They run on a simple, fixed timer, regardless of the actual traffic conditions. You've probably been stuck at a red light while the cross-street is completely empty. That's an inefficient, "dumb" traffic light.

**Our Goal:** To build a "smart" traffic light controller. This controller, an AI agent, will look at the current traffic, predict what's coming soon, and make intelligent decisions to minimize waiting time and keep traffic flowing smoothly.

**The "Zero-Shot" Twist:** Our main innovation is to create a single, smart "brain" that can be trained on a few simulated intersections and then be deployed to control **any new, unseen intersection** without needing to be retrained from scratch. This makes our solution scalable and general-purpose.

## Part 1: The "World" - Our Digital Sandbox (SUMO)

Obviously, we can't experiment with real-world traffic lights. So, we use a highly realistic traffic simulator called **SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)**.

Think of SUMO as our video game or digital sandbox. It allows us to:
1.  Build any road network we can imagine.
2.  Create any traffic pattern, from a few cars to a massive traffic jam.
3.  Have full control over the traffic lights.

SUMO is our safe, controlled laboratory where we can train our AI and run all our experiments.

## Part 2: The "Brain" - Our AI Agent

The core of our project is the AI agent, or the "brain." We teach it to be a good traffic controller using a technique called **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**.

It's easiest to understand with an analogy: **teaching a dog a new trick.**

-   The **Agent** is the dog.
-   The **Environment** is you, the owner.
-   The **State** is what the dog sees (e.g., your hand signal, you holding a treat).
-   The **Action** is what the dog does (e.g., it sits, it barks).
-   The **Reward** is the treat you give for a good action (sitting) or the "No!" you say for a bad one (barking).

By getting rewards over and over, the dog's brain eventually learns: "When I see *this state*, I should do *that action* to get a treat."

**Here's how this applies to our project:**

-   Our **Agent** is the AI controlling the traffic light.
-   The **Environment** is our SUMO simulation.
-   The **State** (what our agent "sees" at every moment) is a combination of two things:
    1.  **Reactive Data:** "How many cars are waiting in each lane *right now*?"
    2.  **Proactive Data:** "How much traffic does our forecast predict is coming in the next 5, 10, and 15 minutes?" (This is our secret sauce!)

-   The **Action** (what our agent can "do") is a very simple choice:
    1.  **STAY:** Keep the current light green.
    2.  **SWITCH:** Change the lights to the next phase in the cycle.

-   The **Reward** (how we train the agent):
    -   We want to minimize waiting time. So, we give the agent a **negative reward** based on how long all the cars had to wait during the last few seconds.
    -   By always trying to get the highest possible score, the agent automatically learns to make decisions that **minimize waiting time**. It learns that making cars wait is "bad."

## Part 3: The "Teacher" - How the Brain Learns

So how does the learning actually happen? We use our `trainer.py` script, which acts as the "teacher."

1.  We put a "baby" agent with a random, untrained brain in control of the simulation.
2.  We let it run for hundreds of "episodes" (simulated hours).
3.  At first, its decisions are random and terrible. Traffic is a disaster, and it gets very bad (very negative) reward scores.
4.  But after every single action, it remembers the outcome. It slowly learns, "When I saw that big queue and switched the light, my score got a little better. I should try that again." Or, "When I switched the light with no one waiting, my score got much worse. That was a bad move."
5.  Over thousands of these tiny trial-and-error experiences, the agent's brain (the neural network) slowly builds a complex strategy for how to act in any given situation to maximize its reward.

## Part 4: The "Final Exam" - How We Prove It Works

Once the agent is trained, we need to test it fairly. This is done by the `runner.py` script.

1.  We take the fully trained agent and put it in control of a standardized, challenging traffic scenario.
2.  We turn **off** learning mode. The agent is no longer guessing; it's only using the strategy it has learned.
3.  We run the simulation and record the final numbers for our key metrics: Average Wait Time, Average Queue Length, and Total Throughput.

**The Comparison:** To prove our agent is effective, we don't just test our main agent (DQN). We compare its final exam score against:

-   A **"Dumbest" Controller (Fixed-Time):** A simple timer, to prove that using AI is better than using no intelligence.
-   A **"Simpler" AI (Tabular Q-Learning):** To show *why* a sophisticated neural network is necessary.
-   A **"Smarter" AI (D3QN):** To see how our chosen model stacks up against more advanced methods.

This rigorous comparison gives us the data we need for the tables in Chapter 3.

## What We've Accomplished and What's Next

So far, we have successfully built this entire pipeline from start to finish. We have trained all the agents and run the final exams, and we have the preliminary results for Chapter 3 that show our DQN approach is highly effective.

**The Next Step (Phase 2) is the most important part of the thesis: The "Zero-Shot" Test.**

We will take the DQN agent that we trained on our first intersection and test its performance on **brand new, unseen intersections** in SUMO. We will do this *without any retraining*. If the agent can still effectively manage traffic in these new environments, we will have proven our thesis: that it is possible to create a general-purpose traffic control agent that does not need to be retrained for every new intersection it encounters.
