# Project State and Next Steps

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the thesis project, clarifies the purpose of the files we have created, and lists the key commands needed to reproduce the results for Chapter 3.

## 1. Current Project State & File Status

We have successfully built a complete, end-to-end pipeline for training and evaluating multiple reinforcement learning agents. The project is now in a robust state, with a clear and repeatable workflow.

### Key Script Status:

-   `sumo_environment.py`: **Permanent.** This is a core, reusable component that wraps the SUMO simulation. It is stable and ready for future experiments.

-   `dqn_agent.py`: **Permanent.** This contains the architecture for your primary proposed model. It is the centerpiece of your research.

-   `q_learning_agent.py` & `d3qn_agent.py`: **Permanent (For Comparison).** These files are crucial for the comparative analysis in Chapter 3. They will likely not be changed, but they serve as essential benchmarks to prove the effectiveness of your chosen DQN model.

-   `trainer.py`: **Permanent.** This is now a universal training script. It is a key part of your research workflow and can be used to train any new agent you might develop in the future.

-   `runner.py`: **Permanent.** This is your scientific measurement tool. To answer your question directly: **Yes, this script is designed to be used in Phase 2 (Zero-Shot Deployment).** To test your agent on a new, unseen intersection, you would simply point this script to a new SUMO configuration file.

-   `generate_analysis.py`: **Permanent.** This script automatically generates your results tables from the raw data. This is a crucial component for ensuring your results are reproducible.

## 2. What to do with the "Chapter 3" Artifacts?

You asked if the models and reports we just generated are now irrelevant. Not at all! They are a permanent, crucial snapshot of a completed experiment. They are the **proof** for the claims made in your Chapter 3.

However, to keep the project organized for the next phase, it is best practice to archive them.

### Files to Archive:

-   The trained models: `models/q-learning_agent.pkl`, `models/dqn_agent.pth`, `models/d3qn_agent.pth`.
-   The raw results log: `results.csv`.
-   The generated reports: `analysis_report.html`, `Chapter3_Full_Layout.md`, etc.

### Recommendation:

I recommend creating a new directory called `experiments/chapter3_preliminary/` and moving all of these files into it. This preserves your work for future reference (e.g., for your thesis appendix) and keeps the main project directories clean for your next set of experiments.

## 3. Reproducibility

You asked if this work can be reproduced for your adviser. **Yes, absolutely.**

The entire workflow is captured in the scripts we have created. By re-running the commands listed below, you can regenerate the `results.csv` file from scratch. Running the `generate_analysis.py` script will then perfectly reproduce the `analysis_report.html`.

*Note: Due to the random nature of reinforcement learning training, the exact numerical results in `results.csv` may vary slightly with each full run, but the overall conclusions (e.g., DQN significantly outperforming Fixed-Time) will remain consistent.*

## 4. Key Commands for Showcase & Future Use

Here is a concise list of the commands needed to demonstrate your complete workflow, from training the agents to generating the final analysis.

### A. Training Commands

```bash
# To train the Tabular Q-Learning agent:
.venv/bin/python src/trainer.py --agent q-learning --episodes 150

# To train the main DQN agent:
.venv/bin/python src/trainer.py --agent dqn --episodes 150

# To train the advanced D3QN agent:
.venv/bin/python src/trainer.py --agent d3qn --episodes 150
```

### B. Evaluation Commands

*First, ensure `results.csv` is deleted to start with a clean slate: `rm results.csv`*

```bash
# 1. Evaluate the Fixed-Time controller:
.venv/bin/python src/runner.py --agent fixed-time

# 2. Evaluate the trained Q-Learning agent:
.venv/bin/python src/runner.py --agent q-learning --model-path models/q-learning_agent.pkl

# 3. Evaluate the trained DQN agent:
.venv/bin/python src/runner.py --agent dqn --model-path models/dqn_agent.pth

# 4. Evaluate the trained D3QN agent:
.venv/bin/python src/runner.py --agent d3qn --model-path models/d3qn_agent.pth
```

### C. Analysis Command

```bash
# To generate the final HTML report from the results:
.venv/bin/python src/generate_analysis.py
```
