# Gemini Debugging Session Summary: 10-11-2025

This document summarizes a debugging session focused on resolving an issue where different trained models produced identical evaluation results.

## 1. Initial Goal: Code Review & Commits

The session began with a request to analyze the current state of the git repository and propose a series of logical commits for the user to make. This involved:
-   Running `git status` to identify modified, deleted, and untracked files.
-   Reading the content of all changed files.
-   Proposing three distinct commits with detailed messages:
    1.  **feat(analysis):** Adding `total_reward` as a metric and implementing decision logging.
    2.  **refactor(training):** Stabilizing DQN training by adjusting the learning rate and improving the GUI.
    3.  **chore:** Adding new trained models and project documentation.

## 2. Pivot to "Identical Results" Bug Investigation

The user pivoted the goal to re-investigating and verifying a fix for a past bug where different models produced identical evaluation metrics. The user's hypothesis was that the bug was still present in the Python application logic, not the environment.

## 3. The Debugging and Verification Process

We executed a multi-step plan to test this hypothesis:

1.  **Code Correction:** We ensured the forecast lookup logic in `src/sumo_environment.py` was correct by restoring a modulo operation (`%`) to the timestamp calculation.

2.  **Model Training:** We trained two distinct DQN models to serve as our test subjects:
    -   `models/dqn_bug_testing_low.pth` (10 episodes)
    -   `models/dqn_bug_testing_high.pth` (150 episodes)

3.  **Dependency Resolution:** The training process failed due to missing `pandas` and `prophet` dependencies. Following user guidance, we correctly added these to the project using the `uv pip install` command.

4.  **Data Pipeline Bug Fix:** We discovered that the `forecasting.py` script was generating a corrupted forecast file containing duplicate time-of-day keys. This was a critical bug. We fixed the script to ensure it only outputs a clean, non-repeating 24-hour forecast.

5.  **Re-evaluation:** With the code and data pipeline seemingly fixed, we re-ran the evaluation on both the 10-episode and 150-episode models. **The results were still identical.**

6.  **Diagnostic Logging:** To get to the root cause, we modified `src/runner.py` to log the agent's full state vector and its chosen action at key steps during the evaluation.

## 4. Final Conclusion: The "Smoking Gun"

The diagnostic logs from the final evaluation runs provided the definitive answer:

-   **Identical States:** Both the 10-episode and 150-episode models were fed the exact same state vectors at every corresponding step of the simulation.
-   **Identical Actions:** Faced with identical inputs, both models—despite having different weights—chose the exact same sequence of actions.

This proves why the final metrics are identical. The behavior is completely deterministic. This result strongly supports the conclusion from the original `1008_debugging_session.md` file: the issue is not a simple logic bug in one file but a deeper, emergent issue related to the environment on the current system that is causing the simulation to be deterministic in a way that overrides the models' different weights.

**The recommended next step remains to build a completely fresh virtual environment on a new operating system, which aligns with your plan.**
