 if im not mistaken, the prophet output/forecasting should be done per direction right? like
  northbound southbound westboun eastbound. is that mentioend somewhere in docs? i dont think ive
  implemenmted that yet. do not do it yourself. im just asking for refernce. @docs/
  @src/forecasting.py

âœ¦ Yes, you are absolutely correct. Your documentation clearly states that the forecasting should be
  done per direction.

  Specifically, in docs/0924_pipeline_overview.md, under Phase 1, Step 2: Generate the "Expected
  Demand Curves", it says:

  > -   We run our prophet_forecaster.py script four times, once on each of the prophet_input_*.csv
  files.
  > -   Output: Four demand_curve_*.json files (e.g., demand_curve_north.json).

  Your current implementation does not do this. The src/forecasting.py script takes a single input
  and produces a single output. The runner.py and trainer.py scripts then use this one "dummy"
  forecast file for all four directions.

  This is another significant bug in the pipeline that we have just uncovered. It is very likely a
  contributing factor to the identical results, as all four "proactive" components of the agent's
  state vector are receiving the exact same forecast data. The agent isn't getting directional
  information about the future, which would severely limit its ability to learn a nuanced strategy.
